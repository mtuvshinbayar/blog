Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology that allows immersion in virtual worlds created by computers. VR is already widely used in gaming, but its potential extends far beyond that.

VR can be applied in medicine for patient rehabilitation, in education for creating engaging lessons, in architecture for visualizing projects, and in many other fields.

VR opens up new opportunities for interacting with the world, creating new types of experiences and changing the way we perceive reality.
