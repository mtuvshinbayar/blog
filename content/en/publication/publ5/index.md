Space exploration has not ceased since the first human flight into space. We continue to study the planets of the Solar System, explore the Universe, and dream of interstellar travel.

Humanity strives to understand space and its place within it. We study the history of the Universe, search for new planets where life might have originated.

Space exploration is not only about scientific discoveries but also a source of inspiration and hope for the future.
