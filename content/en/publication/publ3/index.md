Genetic engineering is a field of science that allows us to modify the genetic code of living organisms. This opens up unprecedented possibilities for treating genetic diseases, developing new medicines, and improving agricultural productivity.

However, it also raises serious ethical questions: can we edit the human genetic code? What will happen to biological diversity?

Genetic engineering is a powerful tool that requires a responsible approach and deep ethical discussions.
